Alright. It's up and running !

Well, it's customary to introduce oneself before bragging on topics one claims to have an acquaintance with, so here we go.

### Regarding "equo"

Back in the day, when I was a bit younger, **Sabayon** was my operating system of choice. Sabayon uses Entropy for package management with **equo** as the command line client side application for Entropy. It was (and still is) capable of installing, removing and updating packages, resolving dependences, reverse dependency handling and many more to start with.

Now I do not use Sabayon as much, but the name **equo**, has lingered on for reasons unknown.
